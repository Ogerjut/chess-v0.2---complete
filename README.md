CHESS GAME (NOT AI, NOT ONLINE MODE)

Developped with pygame and OOP paradigm

Improvments I wanna include in 0.3 version : 
- pawn promotion pannel
- MVC Architecture
- Game states with State design pattern
- to use pygame.Vector2() for pieces coord (easier to calculate distance, normalize direction...)
- improving the move_manager file : computing all the possible moves once a piece is moved before the beggining of another turn
- better UI (game icon, captured pieces icons, turns number, moves logs...)
- PEP8 formating
- constants file & magics numbers
