CHESS GAME (NO AI, NO ONLINE MODE)

Developped with pygame and OOP paradigm

Improvments I wanna include : 
- MVC Architecture
- Game states with State design pattern
- using pygame.Vector2() for pieces coord (easier to calculate distance, normalize)
- improving the move_manager files : computing all the possibles moves once a piece is moved before the begging of another turn
